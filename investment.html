            <p class="section-subheader center-text color">Investing in real estate is one of the oldest forms of investing.</p>

            <p class="section-text">
              Many investors already own their own homes or are paying off mortgages,
              so they have a sizeable portion of their overall net worth tied to a hard
              asset. But there are several other ways to invest in real estate including
              secondary properties, real estate income trusts and alternatives such as
              real estate limited partnerships. The key thing to remember is that no one
              asset type should take up more than 50% of an investor’s portfolio, but
              how you get to that level can be dramatically different from person to
              person.

            You already know that when it comes to investments,
            you have many options. You can walk with the bulls and
            bears on Wall Street, or you can invest in mutual funds.
            You can focus on retirement saving accounts, REITs and
            a whole alphabet of options. But when you look at real
            estate investing versus some of these other investment
            vehicles, you see that <span class="semi-strong">real estate investing offers you the
            best opportunity</span> to create a <span class="color italic">diverse</span>, <span class="color italic">secure</span>, and
            <span class="color italic">financially profitable</span> portfolio. Real estate is a finite
            resource – <span class="semi-strong">no one is making any more land</span> - and the
            demand for this resource is always climbing.
            These two factors alone create the <span class="color italic">Financial Security</span> you
            desire in your investment portfolio.
          </p>

          <br>

          <p class="section-text justified">
            Let's begin with the end in mind, and start at the finish
            line. What are your dreams of <span class="color italic">financial freedom</span>? What
            color and shape do they take? Do you see your Financial
            Freedom in a yacht on the high seas, or in a cabin on a
            snowy slope? Do you want to enjoy the freedom of
            "getting away from the world", or of the busy streets of
            New York, London, or Tokyo?
            For you, does Financial Freedom mean never having to
            worry about the monthly bills, or the knowledge that you
            have all the money you will ever need to secure the
            educational dreams of your children?
            You may be skeptical or uncertain that you can achieve
            your own dreams of Financial Freedom - the old "it will
            never happen to me" scenario. <span class="strong italic">But it can happen to
            you.</span>
          </p>

          <br>

          <p class="section-text justified">
            Have you started to think about your <span class="semi-strong">retirement</span> yet?
            We hope you have done more than think about it... we
            hope you have started to plan for it! Consider the type of
            retirement you wish to enjoy, from sitting on the beach
            with your laptop writing your novel, to working in your
            garden on your favorite plants, to just playing with the
            grandchildren; no matter what you want to do, you know
            that you must have the financial ability to secure it.
            No matter if you are 25 or 55, <span class="color">today is always a good day
            to plan for tomorrow</span> (In fact, you can leverage age, and
            time, greatly to your advantage in real estate investing).
            What does your future look like, and how do you get
            there?
            From retirement, to a career change, to your children
            education, how many properties do you need to own to
            make your <span class="italic">dreams</span> a reality?

            An interesting article appeared in the newspaper
            recently. It reported that the vast majority of people,
            when asked if they would quit their job if they won the
            lottery, actually said no, they would show up for work the
            next day. Like winning the lottery, one of the greatest
            benefits of real estate investing is the <span class="color italic">flexibility</span> the
            investment creates for you&mdash;of time, money, and options!
            Changing jobs or changing careers can be scary. We
            appreciate that. And that is why we offer you the insights
            you need to transition your career to match your personal
            needs. <span class="semi-strong">Do you want to be a part-time investor?</span> Remain
            focused on building your current career and work part
            time hours to invest in real estate. Do you want to partner
            with other like-minded investors and form a team that
            works tighter to build a portfolio? That's an option, too.
            Maybe you want to take a big leap. Maybe you dipped
            your toes into real estate investing and liked what you felt
            and saw. Perhaps you are ready for a complete change,
            where you <span class="color semi-strong">take control of your life</span>, where you are the
            <span class="color strong">"boss of your future."</span>
