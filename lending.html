              It used to be fairly easy to put a term to a lender that accurately described them
              and the types of mortgages they originated. <span class="italic">Time</span>, <span class="italic">the S&L problems</span> of the late
              eighties, and <span class="italic">a maturing marketplace</span> have served to <span class="italic">"blend"</span> those differences.
              Some old adjectives barely apply now and are rarely used.

            A <span class="italic">true</span> <span class="semi-strong color">Mortgage Banker</span> is a lender that is large enough to originate loans and
            create pools of loans which they sell directly to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie
            Mae, jumbo loan investors, and others. <span class="semi-strong">Any company that does this is considered
            to be a mortgage banker.</span> They can vary greatly in size. Some may service the
            loans they originate, but not all of them will. <span class="italic">Most</span> true mortgage bankers have
            wholesale lending divisions.
          </p>

          <p class="section-text justified">
            Examples of two of the largest mortgage bankers are <span class="color">Countrywide Home Loans</span>
            and <span class="color">Wells Fargo Mortgage</span>. One is associated with a bank and the other is not,
            but both are most correctly classified as mortgage bankers.
          </p>

          <p class="section-text justified">
            A lot of companies call themselves mortgage bankers and some deserve the title.
            For others, it is mostly marketing.

            <span class="semi-strong color">Mortgage Brokers</span> are companies that originate loans with the intention of
            brokering them to wholesale lending institutions. A broker has established
            relationships with these companies. Underwriting and funding takes place at the
            wholesale lender. <span class="italic">Many mortgage brokers are also correspondents</span>, which is why
            many of them <span class="semi-strong italic">also</span> claim to be mortgage bankers.

          <p class="section-text justified">

            <span class="italic">Most</span> <span class="semi-strong">mortgage bankers</span> and <span class="semi-strong">portfolio lenders</span> also act as <span class="semi-strong color">wholesale lenders</span>,
            catering to mortgage brokers for <span class="italic">loan origination</span>. Some wholesale lenders do <span class="strong">not</span>
            even have their own retail branches, relying <span class="italic">solely</span> on mortgage brokers for their
            loans.
          </p>

          <p class="section-text justified">
            These wholesale divisions offer loans to mortgage brokers at a <span class="italic">lower cost</span> than
            their retail branches offer them to the general public. The mortgage broker then
            adds on his fee. The result for the borrower is that the <span class="semi-strong">loan costs about the same
            as if he obtained a loan directly from a retail branch of the wholesale lender.</span>
